    A placeholder Monte Carlo simulation function that:
    1. Takes a numpy array of historical returns (daily or weekly).
    2. Simulates random paths for a given horizon (e.g., 252 trading days).
    3. Returns a list of final simulated prices.

    Parameters:
    - returns_array: A numpy array (or list) of historical returns, e.g., daily percentages.
    - n_simulations: How many separate simulation paths to run.
    - horizon: Over how many 'days' (or periods) each simulation runs.
    - initial_price: The starting price for each simulation.

    Returns:
    - final_prices: A list (length n_simulations) of the final price from each simulation path.
